# applied_economics_master_projects

This repository contains 3 of university projects
* A study of the [affordable care act](https://github.com/janelacode/applied_economics_master_projects/blob/main/ACA_project/ACA_project.pdf) using STATA to a regression on an empirical model. I used the difference in differences identification strategy.
* A study of the [effects of oil price on inflation](https://github.com/janelacode/applied_economics_master_projects/blob/main/CPI_oil/project.pdf) using R.
This project is structured in two parts. 
    * First, I analyze the data and perform an augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF) to test whether the series contains a unit root. Then I find the optimal lag order (with the smallest information criterion) and produce a forecast using ARMA.
    * Second, I extend model to incorporate the oil price as exogenous regressor. I test causality and finally conclude that oil price strongly affects inflation
* A study of the [effects of female leadership in EU countries on companie's performance](https://github.com/janelacode/applied_economics_master_projects/blob/main/female%20lead%20effect/female_lead_effect.pdf). I ran regressions on data from the BEEPs database and tested the variance of my error terms (Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity) to make sure my results are unbiased. My conclusion is a negative effect of female ownership on company's performance (sadly).
